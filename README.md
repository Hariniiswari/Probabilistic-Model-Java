Implementation of Probabilistic Model in Java

AIM: -
	To implement Probabilistic model in java.
  
PROCEDURE:-
STEP 1: Give the no of documents as an input.
STEP 2: Give the no of query as an input.
STEP 3: Give the matrix value as an input.
STEP 4: Give the relevant documents as an input.
STEP 5: Find the probabilistic value for all the relevant and non-relevant documents and their query.
STEP 6: Find the similarity value for all the documents.
STEP 7: Find the rank for all the documents.
STEP 8: Based on the threshold value the documents are separated as relevant and non-relevant documents.
STEP 9: The results are obtained.

LANGUAGE USED: Java

TOOL USED: Eclipse IDE
